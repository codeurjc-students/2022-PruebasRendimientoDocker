# DataSet Manager

The objective of this project is to create a cli tool to manage the [clothing-dataset-small](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small) and insert it into a postgres database.

All the commands are strongly attached to the directory structure of the repository. So, if you want to use this tool, you should clone the repository and follow the instructions below.

## Pre-requisites

- Clone the clothing-dataset-small from the original [repository](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small
    ```

- Have a postgres database running.

## More information

<!-- TODO: Link the postres initialization documentation here -->
An actual use case explanation of this tool can be found in the app-php-apache project [here]().
